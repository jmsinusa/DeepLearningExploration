# Overview: Using census data which contains data a person's age, education, marital status, and occupation
# (the features), we will try to predict whether or not the person earns more than 50,000 dollars a year
# (the target label). We will train a logistic regression model that, given an individual's information,
# outputs a number between 0 and 1â€”this can be interpreted as the probability that the individual has an annual
# income of over 50,000 dollars.
